      <h1>About Our Website</h1>
      <p>
        This website is dedicated to honoring and remembering the fallen heroes 
        who made the ultimate sacrifice in the Iron Swords War. Our mission is 
        to preserve their stories, ensure their legacy lives on, and provide a 
        space for friends, family, and the community to come together in 
        remembrance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using advanced technologies like Google Maps integration, our platform 
        allows visitors to explore and connect with the heroes' hometowns, read 
        their stories, and contribute additional details. We aim to create a 
        meaningful digital memorial that serves as a bridge between the past, 
        the present, and the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in the importance of memory, community, and education. This 
        website is more than a tribute; it is a tool for ensuring the sacrifices 
        of our heroes are never forgotten.
